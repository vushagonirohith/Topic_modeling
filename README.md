Social Media Topic Modeling and Trend Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing social media posts (mainly from Twitter) to uncover emerging trends through Topic Modeling. By scraping tweets using specific hashtags or topics, preprocessing the text data, and applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Word2Vec for topic modeling, this tool allows you to visualize and track how social media discussions evolve over time.

Features
-Social Media Data Collection: Scrapes tweets from Twitter using the Selenium web scraping library.
-Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the collected tweet data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
-Topic Modeling: Applies LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) or embedding-based models like Word2Vec to uncover the most relevant topics in a dataset.
-Trend Analysis: Analyzes how topics evolve over time, identifying changes in the prominence of topics.
-Visualization: Visualizes the trends of discovered topics over time, helping to understand the shift in public conversations.
Technologies Used
-Python: Primary programming language used for development.
-Selenium: Web scraping tool used to collect tweets from Twitter.
-NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit used for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
-Gensim: Topic modeling library used to train and apply LDA models.
-Word2Vec: Embedding-based approach for generating word representations and improving topic modeling.
-Pandas: Data manipulation and processing library used for handling tweet data.
-Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries used for visualizing trends and topics over time.
